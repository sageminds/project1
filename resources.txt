I read through the Bootstrap documentation to ensure I pulled only the information I needed.

I reread information on Flex Boxes from here:
http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

I needed to read and re-read the instructor notes carefully to be sure I had all the set up information correct. The tip to overlay the pdf transparently on the code was SUPER!

I sketched the page structure and then wrote the html code. I read through the bootstrap.css file and realized that the grid and normalize.css code was all taken care. 

From there, I wrote the basic CSS elements I still needed to tweak.

I read through the posts and of classmates in the Piazza space to make sure I wasn't missing something important. I waited to review the posts until this phase of the project because I wanted to make sure I struggled through, and solved, my own issues.

I could visually see that I was very close, and was able to focus on minor CSS tweaks and was thrilled when I submitted with a 0% mismatch!

In the end the only resources that I really needed was here:
Instructor Notes
